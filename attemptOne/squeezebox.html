          This can be a bit tricky, because there's two things you need to keep in mind. Where's best for both your broadband and your Wi-Fi signal. Here are some tips to help you decide.

          First of all, find your <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=master+telephone+socket&oq=master+telephone+socket">master telephone socket</a>. This is the best socket to connect your router to. It's usually closest to where the telephone line comes into your home or office. You don't have to connect your router to this one. But you'll get the best broadband performance from it, especially if you have a poor quality or long line.
          <br>
          If you find your broadband works just as well in other sockets, go ahead and use them instead. But if you're having problems, like connection dropping regularly, use the master socket whilst you're sorting it out.

          For the strongest connection, it's best to put your router:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            out in an open space in your home or office, that's not on the floor
          </li>
          <li>
            close to your computer (somewhere central in your home or office is best
          </li>
          <li>
            away from any thick walls, metal objects or electrical appliances.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Don't worry if you can't do them all, but do as many as you can.

          Your router uses radio signals, which can be interrupted by other electrical appliances in your home. Microwaves, Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, fridges and baby monitors are some of the most common culprits. So try and keep your router away from them.
          <br>
          If you're getting a lot of problems when you use a cordless phone, you might need to get one that broadcasts on a higher frequency. Before you buy one, tell the retailer about the problem you're having, so they can advise you on the best phone.
