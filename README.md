# Frontend Developer Test - The Accordion

* Your task is to create an 'accordion' component
* You may use the approach you deem appropriate
* The design and content have been provided
* Allow yourself up to 2 hours for the task
* Allow an additional 15 minutes at the end to document what's missing due to time constraints, or to suggest ways in which your code could be improved were you given additional time to do so
* Once your time is up:
    - Zip up the contents of your work (including any additional notes) and name the file using the convention: `frontend-test-accordion--full-name.zip`
    - Provide us with a [WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) download link to the file

## Design and Content

* Designs are provided in several formats, including: Sketch, Figma, Adobe XD and flat images (PNG/SVG), showing expected style and sizings at mobile, tablet and desktop. If you do not have any software to collect accurate information from, you can sign up for a free [Figma account](https://www.figma.com/) - it's platform-independent and can run in your browser. You'll be able to open the `.fig` file using Figma
* Content for the accordion sections is provided both in markdown and `.rtf` format.

## How you'll be assessed

* You are *not* expected to produce production-ready code in this test, nor do we expect you to complete the entire task
* We're looking for quality and correct-ness over quantity of code completed.
