            <p>Your router uses radio signals, which can be interrupted by other electrical appliances in your home. Microwaves, Bluetooth devices, cordless phones, fridges and baby monitors are some of the most common culprits. So try and keep your router away from them.</p>
            <p>If you're getting a lot of problems when you use a cordless phone, you might need to get one that broadcasts on a higher frequency. Before you buy one, tell the retailer about the problem you're having, so they can advise you on the best phone.</p>
